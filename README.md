# Elon's tweets
Small web project to speedrun reading Elon Musk's tweets.
It provides a split timer, progress bar and (not so) many more features!
It uses a 2010-2021 tweets dataset created by Andrada Olteanu ([Available here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/all-elon-musks-tweets))

## I want more tweets!
The provided python script is used to process the CSV file into a JSON. Then you can add the output into the proper javascript code. Modifying the python script you can get a different output with more (or less) tweets. You can also load them using twitter's API instead of a list. That's on you.
## Why didn't you do it like this [insert suggestion]?
I know is hacky in places, but it was made in a short period of time, and I had to battle many quirks of twitter's API/widgets/limits
## Does it have bugs?
Yup, those are free. It should be pretty stable tho.
## Are you going to fix X?
Probably not.
## But why?
Yes!
